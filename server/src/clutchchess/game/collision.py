"""Collision detection for Clutch Chess.

Pieces capture each other when they get within a certain distance (0.4 squares)
during movement. The piece that started moving earlier wins the capture.

Special rules:
- Knights only capture at their destination (they jump over pieces)
- Pawns moving straight cannot capture (only diagonal moves can capture)
- In head-on collisions, the piece that started earlier wins
